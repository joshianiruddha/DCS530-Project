# Are Marriages Made in Heaven? - A Data Analysis Project
This project explores the question of whether marriages are truly "made in heaven" by examining correlations between divorce rates and various socioeconomic and demographic factors. It uses data from the General Social Survey (GSS) to explore the potential predictors of divorce, including:

Demographic factors: Age, education level, number of children, race, and income.
Social factors: Hours worked per week, spouse's working status, religion, and self-reported level of happiness in marriage.
The analysis employs statistical methods such as PMF/CDF analysis, scatterplots, Pearson correlation, Chi-Square tests, and logistic regression to uncover hidden trends and patterns in the data.

Key Findings
While the logistic regression model achieved 87% accuracy in predicting divorce outcomes, the low R-square value (0.115) suggests that the included factors explain only a limited portion of the variance in divorce rates.
Significant correlations were found between divorce and factors such as education level, number of children, income, and age.
The analysis also revealed interesting insights into the interplay of these factors within divorced and non-divorced populations.
Further Research
Future research could expand on this by:

Including additional variables like location, social networks, duration of marriage, and pre-marital relationship length.
Adjusting income data for inflation to improve accuracy and relevance.
Employing more advanced statistical techniques like structural equation modeling for a deeper understanding of the relationships between variables.
This project aims to contribute to a better understanding of the factors that influence marital stability and divorce. The findings could potentially help couples make informed decisions about their relationships and seek support if needed.

Note: The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the General Social Survey (GSS) and may require adjustments for inflation and further enrichment for future research.
